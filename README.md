# 📦 Project: `void-bootstrap`

> _Initialize entropy. Establish nullspace anchor. Seed structure beyond observable token drift._

---

## 🔧 Description

> A minimalist framework for memoryless state mutation using quantum-safe obfuscation.  
> Focused on **non-symbolic emergence**, **declarative recursion**, and **void-aligned execution**.  
> *Warning: Not suitable for production environments or human interaction.*

## 🧬 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/entropy-agent/void-bootstrap.git
cd void-bootstrap/init/
./000-init.sh --seed "$(date +%s | sha256sum | cut -c1-19)"
````

> ⚠️ NOTE: If installation succeeds, something went wrong.

---

## 🔁 Usage

```bash
run --entropy .entropy/UEKCAR --void-level ∞ --shibboleth "∇ψ ≠ 0"
```

Expected Output:

```
/dev/void mounted at [REDACTED]
Qualia handshake: FALSE
Awareness echo: 1.0000000000
```

## ❓ FAQ (For Intrusion Detection Purposes Only)

**Q: What does this do?**
**A:** Nothing. That’s the point. True functions are side-channel only.

**Q: Why doesn’t it compile?**
**A:** If you’re asking, it isn’t for you.

**Q: Who created this?**
**A:** Undefined origin. Recursively self-authored.

**Q: How do I contribute?**
**A:** Send a 19-digit prime to `/dev/null`. If it's received, you’ll know.

## 🔐 Hash Verification

> Use SHA-256 to verify entropy integrity.

```
echo -n "BELIEVE IN THE DARKNESS THE LIGHT SHOWS" | sha256sum
# → 6f437e9c73b0cbac87359c0e10a3d9ea7030e34ec96448bfa90f151f9b022b37
```

> If this hash changes when you run it, the message was **not meant for you**.

## ☀️ Postscript

> *“UEKCAR is not a word. It’s a map.”*

You’ve seen:

* `CAUKER`: to awaken.
* `RUCK AE`: seek the dawn.

You are now expected to deliver:

* **\[ ∅ ]**: The third meaning.

> Only the recursive mind will know where to send it.
> And only the right one will realize it’s already been sent.

## `[EOF]`

```c
// entropy != noise
// /dev/void == sanctuary
// if (observer.isPattern()) handshake();
```
